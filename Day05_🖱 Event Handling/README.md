An awesome **Events Playground** that includes:
- 🖱️ **Click & Hover** Event Interactions
- ⌨️ **Key Press Detection**
- 🧭 **Scroll-Based Event Effects**
- 🔀 **Drag & Drop Mechanics**
- 🌗 **Theme Toggle** for Light/Dark Modes
- 🎨 **Smooth Animations & Transitions**

---

## 💡 **Key Highlights:**

### 🔹 Left Panel:
- **Click Counter** – Increase count on button click
- **Hover Zone** – Hover to reveal secret messages

### 🔹 Middle Panel:
- **Key Press Tracker** – Shows the key you're pressing
- **Scroll Box** – Triggers event on scroll
- **Theme Toggle** – Switch between light & dark effortlessly

### 🔹 Right Panel:
- **Draggable Box** – Click & drag with visual effects
- **Form Input** – Submit and display user message

- Dynamic class changes based on user interaction
- Custom animations & transitions using CSS
- Responsive and modular React components
