## ✨ Day 4: Counter App with useState Hook

> 💡 A fun, animated **Counter App** built with React.js using the `useState` hook. This app includes smooth animations, interactive buttons, and dynamic styling based on the counter value (positive or negative).

### 🔍 Features

- 🎨 **Smooth Animations**: Buttons and counter value animate with scaling and color changes.
- 🎮 **Interactive Buttons**: Increase and decrease the counter value with animated buttons.
- 🌗 **Dynamic Styling**: Counter value changes color and size based on whether it's positive or negative.
- 📱 **Responsive Layout**: Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop views.
- ⚛️ **useState Hook**: Hands-on experience with React’s `useState` hook to manage and update state.
