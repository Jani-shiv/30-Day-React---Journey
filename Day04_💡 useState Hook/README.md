## ✨ **What I Built:**
A fun, **animated Counter App** using the **`useState`** hook in React where:
- ⚡ **Interactive Buttons** to **increase** and **decrease** the counter value.
- 🌈 **Smooth Scaling & Color-changing Animations** based on the counter value.
- 🌗 **Dark/Light Theme Toggle** for a visual boost.
- 🔁 **Reusable Component Structure** — one `Counter` component for any value.
- 📱 **Fully Responsive Design** for mobile and desktop views.

---

## 🧠 **Tech & Concepts Used:**
- **React `useState` hook** for managing state.
- **CSS animations** for smooth transitions and button effects.
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle** with `useState`.
- **Event Handling** to manipulate the counter with button clicks.
- **Responsive Design** ensuring it works beautifully on mobile and desktop.
