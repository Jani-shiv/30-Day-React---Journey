## 🌟 Day 3 – Build a Dynamic UserCard Component with Props, 3D Animations & Theme Toggle

> 🔥 “Props diye, 3D banaya, aur card ka swag badhaya!” — Day 3 is all about reusable components, clean props, and some seriously cool animations.

### ✨ What I built:
A fully animated, dynamic `UserCard` component system in React where:
- ⚡ All user data is passed via props.
- 🌈 3D hover & light effects bring cards to life.
- 🌗 Dark / Light theme toggle included.
- 🔁 Reusable design — one component, many faces.
- 📱 Responsive and interactive — built for style and usability.

### 🧠 Tech & Concepts Used:
- React props & reusable components
- CSS 3D animations & lighting effects
- Dark/Light mode toggle with `useState`
- Dynamic rendering with `.map()`
- UI/UX aesthetics inspired by real-world profiles
