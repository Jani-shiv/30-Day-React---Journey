## ✨ **What I Built:**

An elegant **Login Form with Captcha** that includes:
- 🔐 **Username & Password** input fields
- 🧩 **Captcha for Extra Security** with refreshing button
- 🎨 **Responsive & Animated UI**
- ⏩ **Login & Logout Buttons**
- 🌗 **Light/Dark Theme Toggle**

---

## 💡 **Key Highlights:**

### 🔹 Form Elements:
- **Username & Password Fields** – Secure login with validation
- **Captcha** – Ensures that the user is human with a refreshable captcha
- **Login Button** – Submits the login form and triggers the user profile view

### 🔹 Theme Toggle:
- **Light/Dark Mode** – Switch between dark and light themes for a more personalized experience

### 🔹 Logout:
- **Logout Button** – Click to logout and hide the user profile view

---

## 🧠 **Concepts Practiced:**

- `useState` for managing form input states
- Handling user interactions like **Click**, **Focus**, and **Submit**
- Custom animations using CSS transitions
- Conditional rendering for login/logout
- Responsive design using flexbox
- **Captcha integration** for added security
